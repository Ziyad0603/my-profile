               <h2> Well, I am Ziyad Abellaoui from Egypt üá™üá¨ ! I am 18yrs old and currently studying at IESEG School of Management in Lille üåß </h2>

              <h3> Who am I ü§î</h3>
               <p> I am sport-minded guy passionnate about football ‚öΩÔ∏è and music. I have also Moroccan origins alongside my Egyptians. Both cultures are wonderful and full of ressources that help me in everyday life. I spend all my life in Egypt, since the March, 6th of 2003 my birthday ü•≥ </p>

            <div class="box-white" id="foot">
               <h3> Football ‚öΩÔ∏è</h3>
               <p> I've been playing football since I was little, I've developed a real level and I'm even part of the IESEG team. For me football is much more than a sport Stan is a spirit that teaches us rigor, discipline, motivation but above all respect, the most beautiful of values. In full logic, my favourite team is where MBappe, Messi and Neymar are playing, I let you guess it üîµüî¥...

            <div class="box-white" id="rap">
               <h3>Music - Rap </h3>
               <p>Better than a small football match between friends with beautiful music, the music has all its meaning here. It adds an atmosphere and allows us to feel more united between friends because we like the same music. We are therefore even more motivated and determined I love who loves US and UK rap but also French, I particularly like: </p>
